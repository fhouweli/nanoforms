  <h2 id="introduction">Introduction</h2>

  <p>Nanoforms is a collection of php scripts you can upload to your
    hosted server in order to deploy questionnaires and obtain responses.</p>
  <p>Nanoforms helps you deploy html forms you create yourself (that is,
    it does not assist you in questionnaire building) and optionally invite
    prospective respondents with html emails you create yourself.</p>
  <p>Nanoforms stores all data in a single-file <em>sqlite3</em> database. It
    allows you to download the survey responses as text/csv for you to analyze
    yourself.</p>


  <h2 id="overview">Overview</h2>

  <p>In Nanoforms, a <em>survey</em> is a collection of html forms, invitation
    emails and/or privacy statements.</p>
  <p>A survey must have at least one questionnaire form file. It may have more
    than one form, for example in case of more languages or different
    respondent targets. Different forms may have completely different questions
    and input fields.</p>
  <p>Surveys are of two types: <em>public</em> and <em>by invitation</em>. In
    the former case you publish a link to a page where respondents register to
    obtain a personal link to the questionnaire; in the latter case you send
    a personal link by email to prospective respondents you already know. At
    your choice, Nanoforms can do the posting of your emails or generate a
    list of personal links you can mailmerge yourself.</p>
  <p>Respondents of <em>by invitation</em> surveys are called
    <em>subscribers</em>. Subscribers are not linked to any particular survey;
    for every mailing you select the group of subscribers you want to invite.
    These subscribers may carry data (called <em>start data</em>) you want to
    use in the questionnaire fields or logic.</p>


  <h2 id="prerequisites">Prerequisites</h2>

  <p>Nanoforms needs the following PHP extensions:<ul>
      <li>gd2</li>
      <li>sqlite3.</li>
    </ul>
  </p>
  <p>You can check by inspecting your server's php.ini file. If your hosting
    provider offers Wordpress sites you should be ok.</p>

  <h2 id="installation">Installation</h2>

  <p>To install Nanoforms, copy the <em>nanoforms</em> directory (plus contents)
    to your server somewhere under the web root directory (often called
    <em>htdocs</em>), and then with your browser visit
    <span class="mono">nanoforms/nanoforms_init.php</span> on your website.</p>
  <p style="margin-left:5%">The directory on your site may actually have any
    name you like. Not that it matters much: the world (your respondents) will
    see this name only inside the url.</p>
  <p><span class="mono">nanoforms_init.php</span> will ask you a few questions:
    <ul>
      <li>your email address (will be used as your login ID)</li>
      <li>a password</li>
      <li>the email address for contact forms
        (like <em>postmaster@etcetera.etc</em>)</li>
      <li>the email address to use as <em>from:</em> address in emails to
        subscribers (like <em>surveys@etcetera.etc</em> - you might want to
        create a dedicated mailbox on your hosting control panel)</li>
      <li>a signature in emails to subscribers of <em>public</em> surveys
        (to whom we send plaintext emails)</li>
      <li>the default validity of links (default that you will always be able
        to override)</li>
    </ul>
    </p>
    and will then create a <em>sqlite3</em> database file
    (<span class="mono">nanoforms.sqlite</span>) in the
    <span class="mono">data</span> directory.</p>

  <p style="margin-left:5%">Nanoforms comes with a
    <span class="mono">.htaccess</span> file
    to prevent outsiders from accessing the  <span class="mono">data</span>
    directory.
    You should check that pointing
    your browser to <span class="mono">nanoforms/data/nanoforms.sqlite</span>
    on your site does not result in a download of the file but in
    error (or maybe a welcome page by your provider) instead. If it does
    download the file you need to find out how to deny access to the
    <span class="mono">data</span> directory in your hosting environment before
    continuing.</p>

  <h2 id="survey">Survey(s)</h2>

  <p>Your first login will bring you to the empty <em>surveys</em> page.
    Add a row (a name, a title, a &check; to make the survey <em>public</em>)
    to create your first survey.</p>
    <p>Once at least one survey has been created, successive logins will bring
      you straight to the latest one.</p>
      <p>The <em>survey</em> page shows the current status of the survey:</p>
      <ul>
        <li>the survey mode (by invitation or public)</li>
        <li>the presence/absence of a questionnaire form</li>
        <li>(if b invitation) the presence/absence of an invite email</li>
        <li>(if public) the presence/absence of a privacy statement</li>
        <li>the validity of links to the questionnaire (defaults to the one
          specified in <span class="mono">nanoforms_init.php</span>)</li>
        <li>do we allow respondents to return to the questionnaire after
        submitting? (yes, only if not complete, read-only, no)</li>
        <li>the survey status (test mode, live or halted)<sup>*</sup></li>
        <li>a small summary of activity so far.</li>
  </ul>

  <p><sup>*</sup> A survey is in test mode per default. To go live, change
    the survey status to <em>live</em>.</p>

  <h2 id="forms">Forms</h2>

  <p>From the <em>survey</em> page you reach the <em>forms</em> upload page.</p>

  <p>A questionnaire (a <em>form</em>) is an html file with a <em>form</em>
  element containing <em>input</em>, <em>select</em> and/or <em>textarea</em>
  elements for the respondent to fill out.</p>

  <p>A form you create will be presented to respondents exactly as you created
    it, without any interventions on the part of Nanoforms,
    <strong>but</strong>:</p>
    <ul>
      <li>you need to adapt the <em>action</em> attribute of the <em>form</em>
        element: instead of <span class="mono">&lt;form method=&quot;post&quot;
        action=&quot;www.etcetera.etc?etc&quot;&gt;</span> write: <span
        class="mono">&lt;form method=&quot;post&quot;
        action=&quot;<strong>%_TARGET_%</strong>&quot;&gt;</span>. Nanoforms
        will replace the <span class="mono"><strong>%_TARGET_%</strong></span>
        placeholder with a link to the page that will process the responses;</li>
        <li>Nanoforms does not handle local resources the questionnaire file
          may link to - like .css files, images or javascript files with
          relative urls. You therefore need to
          <ul>
            <li>either incorporate these resources into the html file itself.
              Images need to be converted into data uris. Nanoforms comes with
              a simple PHP command line utility to accomplish this, but to use
              it you must have PHP installed on your computer.</li>
              <li>or upload the resouces yourself to the <em>nanoforms</em>
                directory</li>
          </ul>
          Of course uploading the resources to some other place and using
          absolute urls to access them is even better;
        </li>
        <li>if you want Nanoforms to speak the language of your respondents
          (just a few phrases, for registering and thank you), make sure the
          <em>html</em> tag contains a <em>language</em> attribute. Like so:<br />
          <span class="mono">&lt;!DOCTYPE html&gt;<br />
            &lt;html lang=&quot;nl&quot;&gt;</span>.<br />
            The presence of this attribute is good practice in any case. On the
            downside, only 3 languages have been implemented for now:
            <span class="mono">en</span>, <span class="mono">it</span> and
            <span class="mono">nl</span>. To add your language, edit
            <span class="mono">participate.php</span>,
            <span class="mono">deploy.php</span> and
            <span class="mono">incoming.php</span>. And please contribute the
            resulting scripts!
          </li>
        </ul>

        <p>On the lower part of the <em>forms.php</em> page you may tell
          Nanoforms when to consider a form <strong>complete</strong>,
          using the 5-level condition builder. Often, you will want one of
          the last questions to be filled out. Example: suppose the input field
          of the last question is called <em>age</em>, then on the first row
          of the builder select <span class="mono">age</span> in the
          <em>field</em> column, then select <span class="mono">!=</span> (not
          equal) in
          the <em>relop</em> column, then press the <em>SUBMIT</em> button
          leaving the <em>value</em> column blank. The page should now
          display</p>
          <p style="margin-left:10%"><span class="big mono">age != &apos;&apos;</span></p>
          <p>as complete condition.</p>



  <h2 id="privacy">Privacy statements</h2>

  <p>In case of a public survey, from the <em>survey</em> page you also reach
    the <em>privacy</em> upload page.</p>
  <p>If your prospective respondents are known to you and are going to be
    invited by you to participate, you obviously already have their consent
    to their data being processed (and further specific issues can be clarified
    in your invite emails).</p>
  <p>If your survey is <em>public</em> you should obtain the respondent&apos;s
    consent before collecting her/his responses. You may upload more than one
    html file for the purpose - for example in case of more than one language.
    In this case the respondent will have to select the appropriate statement
    and it is therefore important that the filenames be meaningful.</p>
  <p style="margin.left:5%">Nanoforms comes with an example template NOT
    read nor approved by any lawyer - use at your own risk!</p>
    <p>Nanoforms will ask the respondent's full name in addition to her/his
      email address, so as to give the &quot;I accept&quot; checkbox some
      more meaning.</p>


  <h2 id="mails">Invite emails</h2>

  <p>If the survey is <em>by invitation</em>, the <em>survey</em> page will
    link to the <em>mails</em> page where you can upload html files containing
    email bodies that Nanoforms may send to prospective respondents. If you
    plan to send the emails yourself you can safely ignore the <em>mails</em>
    page.  </p>
  <p>Of course the body must contain a link for the respondent to the
    questionnaire. To achieve this, use the
    <span class="mono"><strong>%_LINK_%</strong></span> placeholder, either as
    text (respondent&apos;s email client should convert it int a clickable
    link), as in:</p>
    <p style="margin-left:5%">&lt;p&gt;Here is your link to the questionnaire:
      %_LINK_% &lt;/p&gt;</p>
      <p> or as link anchor, as in</p>
      <p style="margin-left:5%"> &lt;p&gt;Here is &lt;a
        href=&quot;%_LINK_%&quot;&gt;your link&lt;/a&gt; to the questionnaire
        &lt;/p&gt;.</p>
      <p>The <span class="mono"><strong>%_LINK_%</strong></span> placeholder
        will be replaced with<br />
        <span class="mono">
          www.etcetera.etc/nanoforms/deploy.php?tk=7b53f29c6fc6d82bbde14e63b463f291
        </span>,
        <br /> where <span class="mono"><strong>tk=</strong></span> is
        followed by a random token assigned to the respondent.</p>
      <p>In order to personalize your invitations, you may use the
        respondent's <em>start data</em>, if present (see below). Any
        <span class="mono">key=value</span> pair in the start data can be
        used as <span class="mono">%_key_%</span> in the mail body: it
        will be replaced by <span class="mono">value</span>.<br />
        Dear %_firstName_%, will be replaced with Dear John, provided that
        firstName=John is present in John&apos;s start data.</p>
      <p>A &quot;mailing&quot; is the sending of email containing a link
        to one specific questionnaire form to a group of prospective
        respondents. Whether you send the emails yourself (through a
        mailmerge with links provided by Nanoforms) or let Nanoforms do the
        sending for you, the process always concerns one single
        questionnaire form at a time. </p>

  <h2 id="subscribers">Subscribers</h2>

  <p><em>Subscribers</em> are the prospective respondents of
    &quot;outgoing&quot; by-invitation surveys. The <em>sample</em>, if you
    prefer. The list of subscribers you maintain in Nanoforms is independent
    of the surveys - any subscriber can be selected by you for any survey.</p>

  <p>You may upload subscribers as rows of csv-files selecting
    <em>Subscribers</em> from the main menu. There are no particular
    restrictions on the format of a subscribers csv file, except that it must
    have a header row and a column named <strong><em>email</em></strong>.</p>
  <p>A subscriber&apos;s email address is used as her/his effective ID, and
    therefore neither empty nor duplicate values in the email column are
    accepted.</p>
  <p>A column named <strong><em>stratum</em></strong>, if present, will
    allow you to easily select groups of subscribers and to view summary
    statistics for each group separately. Language groups come to mind, but
    also classical strata like Nielsen area or company size.</p>
  <p>Any other columns in the csv file will be combined together into a
    single column &quot;<strong><em>start data</em></strong>&quot;, as
    &lt;column-name&gt=&lt;value&gt; pairs. These may be referenced in
    invite emails or questionnaire forms with the %_column-name_%
    placeholder. For example, this text input element:
    <span class="mono">&lt;input type="text" name="nation"
      value="%_nation_%" /&gt;</span> will be presented as
      <input type="text" name="nation" value="Italy" /> if the
      subscriber&apos;s start data contains nation=Italy.</p>
    <p>The upload page for subscriber files (<em>subscribers.php</em>)
      lets you choose what to do in case of duplicate email addresses:</p>
    <ul style="margin-top:-1em">
      <li>discard: keep the one already present</li>
      <li>substitute: keep the new one</li>
      <li>update: replace <em>stratum</em> with the new value;
        in the <em>start data</em> replace values of existing keys
        with the new ones, and add new key=value pairs.</li>
    </ul>
    <p>You can inspect the records of an uploaded subscriber
      file by means of the <em>details</em> button next to the file
      record, and you can inspect or modify single subscriber
      records as well.</p>


  <h2 id="sending">Inviting respondents</h2>

  <p>Two routes lead to the page for sending invite emails
    (<em>mailing.php</em>):</p>
  <ul>
    <li>the upload page for questionnaire forms (<em>forms.php</em>);</li>
    <li>[<em>by invitation</em> surveys only] the upload page for email bodies
      (<em>mails.php</em>).</li>
  </ul>
  <p>In case of a <strong>public</strong> survey, clicking <em>Invite
  subscribers</em> will open <em>publicLink.php</em>, which shows the link
  (url) prospective respondents may follow to participate in the survey. These
  respondents arrive at <em>participate.php</em>, which displays the privacy
  statement and asks for respondent's complete name, email, acceptance of
  the privacy statement and a captcha code. Nanoforms will then send her/him
  a link to the questionnaire form.</p>
  <p>In case of a <strong>by invitation</strong> survey, clicking <em>Invite
  subscribers</em> will open <em>recipients.php</em>, which lists the first 50
  subscribers in the data base and allows you to select the target for your
  mailing.</p>
  <p style="margin-left:5%">You can use the input fields in the column headers
  to select the subset of subscribers you want to invite. For numeric columns,
  use a comparison operator like &lt; or &gt;=. For string columns, use a
  substring. For example, <em>sample1</em> (or <em>%sample1%</em>) in the
  <em>file</em> column to select all subscribers from file sample1.csv. Press
  the <em>Apply filter</em> button to see the effect of your filters.</p>
  <p>If you confirm the selection of subscribers, you will be shown
  <em>mailing.php</em>. Here you confirm the selected form (and email body
  if any), and a few parameters:</p>
  <ul style="margin-top:-1em">
    <li><em>Action</em>: send invite emails or generate links</li>
    <li><em>From</em>: the sender of the emails</li>
    <li><em>Subject</em>: the subject header of the emails</li>
    <li><em>Link validity</em>: for how long will respondents be able to visit
      the questionnaire</li>
    <li><em>This site</em>: shows what Nanoforms believes to be the url to
      your Nanoforms installation. Correct if wrong.</li>
    <li>since the results come as a file (<em>nanoforms-log.csv</em>):<ul>
      <li><em>csv line break</em> (linefeed or carriage return plus linefeed)</li>
      <li><em>column separator</em></li>
    </ul>
  </ul>

  <h2 id="data">Getting the data</h2>

  <p>The page for downloading the data (<em>data.php</em>) as a .csv file
    presents you with a list of questions/options:</p>
  <ul>
    <li><em>csv line break</em> (linefeed or carriage return plus linefeed)</li>
    <li><em>column separator</em> (default semicolon)</li>
    <li><em>date/time format</em> (default Y-m-d H:i): how you want date and
      time represented. You can find a complete reference
      <a href="https://www.php.net/manual/en/datetime.format.php">here</a></li>
    <li><em>final submits only</em>: Nanoforms records all forms submitted by
      a respondent. Depending on the option setting of the <em>survey</em>
      page a repondent may revisit and re-submit a form more than once. The
      default setting is to consider only the last form submitted</em></li>
    <li><em>completes only</em>: consider only forms that satisfy the
      <em>complete</em> condition (default yes)</li>
      <li><em>include test data</em>: consider forms submitted while survey
        was in test mode (default no)</li>
    <li><em>include email</em>: include a column <em>email</em> in the output
      (default no)</li>
    <li><em>include start data</em>: include a column for every key in the
      subscriber's start data (default no).</li>
  </ul>
